                    current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I

                <p class="quotations">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                    amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found in incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
                    a Software Engineer at VR startup."</p>

                    work as a mobile angineer for a big company. This was one of the best

                <p class="quotations">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                    needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                    programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                    hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                    next level in a waythat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                    often referred to it during interviws as an example of my development
                    experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! "</p>

                    Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
                    easy.</p>
          
                <p class="quotations">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
                    really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
                    able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
                    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
